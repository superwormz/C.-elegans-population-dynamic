# _C. elegans_ population (colony) simulation 
The Python script considers: 1) founder number, and 2) food consumption. 
From the founder number, we simulate the dynamic population structure by using a known development schedule (Byerly et al., 1976) at 25Â°C.
This code was originally written by Evgeniy R. Galimov and has been adapted by Suiting Tseng and Kuei-Ching Hsiung.
